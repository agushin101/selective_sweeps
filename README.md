# selective_sweeps

This project aims to understand whether the addition of a spatial structure to a population reduces the accuracy of estimators for the location of
a selective sweep.

calc_well_mixed.sh produces an MSMS (https://www.mabs.at/publications/software-msms/) command that simulates a sweep through a well-mixed population.
read_text.py converts MSMS output to input compatible with SweepFinder2 (http://degiorgiogroup.fau.edu/sf2.html)
